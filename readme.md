# The autocomplete fullstack solution

This project features a complete autocomplete list. It has a good keyboard support and it supports unicode accents. Even if the style and the graphics is quite basic, it't fully functional and it can be adapted to your environment and style. 

It is not using a database because its goal is to be ready to run as soon as downloaded, without having to use databases or database accounts. It simply uses as an example a csv file with all the municipalities of the state of Mina Gerais in Brazil, the monster state with the largest number of municipalities.The user has to choose between 853 different names and it is evident that a scrolling list would not be ideal for that. It shows that it does not distinguish between accented characters, i.e., for example o, ó, ò, ô, ö or even õ are treated in the same way. It works for most European languages. Sure, even if it doesn't use a database it takes a minimal configuration to adapt it to a project using a real database.

The project is public and open to contributions, for example some improvements are missing, such as showing the complete list when the user clicks or taps on the input.
